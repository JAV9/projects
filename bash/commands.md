**be aware that using built-ins and keywords are so much more efficient than commands (executables in external files), especially when invoked repeatedly in a loop**

```
$ compgen -k

if
then
else
elif
.
.
.
```

> You can use the compgen command to determine what commands, built-ins, and keywords are available to you. Use the -c option to list commands, -b for built-ins, and -k for keywords
